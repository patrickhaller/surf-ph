surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.
This has my customizations:
	Act more like tabs in FF or chrome
		Load new clients in the background
		On window close, raise the next client
	Download using webkit, not wget
	Vi mode by default 
		i to insert text
		Esc to return to browse mode
	Emacs mode optional
		set env SURF_EMACS=yes
	Functions + keybindings for window actions
		t - create new window
		q - destroy current window
		Q - exit
	User-agent switching
	

And it includes ssl.patch to show untrusted ssl sites
And it disables spatial navigation by default
